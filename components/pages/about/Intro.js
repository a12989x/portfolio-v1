        Hey there! I‚Äôm Alexis, a self-taught developer exploring what‚Äôs possible

        I like to spend my time building projects that interest me, as well as
        pushing myself to learn more through open source projects and share my
        knowledge with other developers.

        What I‚Äôve been up to
      </Heading>
      <Text mb={20}>
        I{"'"}ve been recently focused on building React (specifically Next.js)
        applications, using popular tools such as Chakra UI and to help me bring
        my designs.

        I‚Äôm currently interested in building tools that help us make things
        faster and more efficient.
      </Text>
      <Text mb={5}>
        I‚Äôm also really into <em>Design Systems</em> and{' '}
        <em>Component Driven User Interfaces</em> and I love to explore the
        tools and techniques that help to create more scalable and maintainable
        UI{"'"}s.
      </Text>
      <Text mb={5}>
        When I{"'"}m not coding (or writing or reading about it) you
        {"'"}ll typically find me engaging with another creative or engaging
        activity such as design, gaming, curating playlists, solving rubik{"'"}s
        cube or getting lost in series!

      <Text>
        Although I love to keep myself busy with activities, I make sure to set
        aside to going for walks and runs.
